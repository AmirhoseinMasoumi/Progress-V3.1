# Description
The Progress board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations of performance and power consumption features, provided by the STM32 microcontroller.       
The Progress board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK debugger/programmer.
